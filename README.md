# Show Smart Plumblines

*This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).*  

By default it displays **live guidelines** at the center of each paths’ `red` and components’ `grey` bounding box.  
If you select anything, it also displays the center of that selection `blue dashed`.  
One major feature is that the guideline **automatically matches your italic angle**.  
This is usefull for aligning objects by sight. As well as:
- Align multiple paths and/or components
- Setting up (horizontal) positions of anchors
- Editing segments while easily keeping italic angle
- etc.
