# Show Smart Plumblines

## Plugin for Glyphsapp

This is a Plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). It displays live Guidelines at the center of all paths’ (red) and components’ (grey) bounding box. If you select anything, it also displays the center of the selection (blue dashed). One major feature is that it takes the italic angle into account. This is usefull for aligning objects visually. In some cases it might match the alignment made by GlyphsApp, while in other cases you rather prefer just the visual feedback

### How to use

Download or clone the whole `Glyphsapp-Plugins`repo (it will contain more plugins soon) and copy the `*.glyphsReporter` into your Glyphsapp Plugins folder (eg. `/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Plugins`), restart Glyphs and when ever you need it, toggle `Show Rotated` from the view menu.
