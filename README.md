# Show Smart Plumblines

## Plugin for Glyphsapp

This is a Plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).  
By default it displays **live guidelines** at the center of each paths’ `red` and components’ `grey` bounding box.  
If you select anything, it also displays the center of that selection `blue dashed`.  
One major feature is that the guideline **automatically matches your italic angle**.  
This is usefull for aligning objects by sight.

### Install
